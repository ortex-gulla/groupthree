                <h3>What is streaming?</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">
                  Streaming refers to any media content (either live or recorded) delivered to computers, smartphones, or similar devices via the internet and played back in real time. It is the (over time) transmission of audio or video files from a server to a client. Some more important points
                </p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">What is live streaming?</span>
                <p>
                   Live streaming is the real-time broadcasting of an event over the internet. The broadcast shows everything that occurs in the live stream at the same time it happens. Though it can sound restrictive, live streams can cover a huge variety of topics. Anyone can host their own live stream as long as they possess a decent internet connection.
                </p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">What's the difference?</span>
                <p>
                  The main difference between the two is that streaming happens in real time. For example, when streaming a video, it loads the video little by little and plays the video without having to download everything completely. It is more convenient and efficient compared to downloading it, as you have to wait until the video is fully downloaded on the device before you are able to view it.
                  </p>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold">How does streaming work?</span>
                  <p>
                  When streaming, the media file is transmitted from the server to the client little by little overtime. This process is made possible by an internet connection. The media to be played is broken down into data packets. Each data packet contains a small piece of the media file, and the medium in which the file will be played within the client’s device receives these data packets and interprets them so the media can be played.

                <p>
                 There is a wide range of types of streaming content you can encounter on the internet, especially with the large and still growing number of aspiring creators on available streaming platforms. However, the most popular mainstream forms of streaming include podcasts, webcasts, movies, TV shows and music videos. The most popular mainstream forms of live streaming include award shows, boxing matches, video game tournaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Streaming content usually comes in the form of a video or audio file. There are many different types of platforms available to post these files online, making it readily available for streaming. Here are a few of the most popular video and audio streaming sites used on the internet:

                <h3>Viewers analysis for three chosen streaming categories</h3>
                <p>
                  Soon, we will also create content for streaming platforms. The team decided to perform research on three categories of streaming we think are best suited for the content we have planned:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Video Game Walkthroughs</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Live Podcasts</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Educational Videos</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We first used the methods of basic research to analyze demographic statistics of the viewers in the selected categories.
                </p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">Analysis on the viewers of Video Game Walkthroughs</span>
                <p>
The viewer population of this category consists of 55% males and 45% females. The average age of the group is 35, consisting mostly of people from 18 to 55 years of age. The majority of people within the group hail from the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia respectively (greatest to least order). On average, people from this group earn around $58,800 per year. <br><br> They enjoy video game walkthroughs for a variety of reasons. Some want to experience the game they don’t have access to, and some just like to see the reactions of others playing the game. They feel that games help develop good problem solving skills, promote teamwork and communication, and are a better form of entertainment than anything on TV.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">Analysis on the viewers of Live Podcasts</span>
                <p>
The viewer population of this category consists of 53.9% males and 46.1% females. The average age of the group is around 13 to 35, but a lot of people outside of that age group also consume podcasts (those above 56 years of age also consume them). The majority of people within the group hail from the United States, India, and Japan respectively (greatest to least order). On average, people from this group earn around $75,000 per year. <br><br> According to listeners, “podcasts give a layer of emotion to journalism that cold, black text on a white screen cannot. The inflection of one’s words, the emphasis on tone, the personality, it’s all lost in a typical article. But not in podcasts.” Additionally, listeners feel that podcasts are an effective way of absorbing information as they are fun to listen to and there are no time and place restrictions in place to listen to them.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">Analysis on the viewers of Educational Videos</span>
                <p>
The viewer population of this category consists of 40% males and 60% females. The average age of the group is 12 to 44, consisting mostly of teachers and students. The majority of people within the group hail from China, Malaysia, Germany, and the United States respectively (greatest to least order). On average, people from this group earn around $53,800 to $57,840 per year. <br><br> Viewers enjoy this content because of how accessible they are and how the information is made comprehensible. Educational videos make viewers connect faster. Effective educational videos significantly improve the memory process by facilitating thinking in the manner of asking questions. Viewers also indicate that educational videos changed their learning approach by making the entire learning process ‘convenient’ and ‘comfortable’.

                <h3>Needs of Viewers and What makes a Good Stream</h3>
                <p>
In order to identify the needs of the viewers, the team conducted a survey that aimed to connect  with our target audience to decide what streaming category to pursue and empathize with them to figure out what needs they possibly have for the chosen streaming category. <br><br> Most (48.1%) of the survey participants chose “video game walkthroughs” as their favorite from the options, therefore we decided to go with this category in order to appeal to the audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the survey, <span style="font-weight: bold">the main reasons</span> the participants watch Gameplay content are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> They find the humor in the videos funny</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The creator is good at playing the game, which is satisfying to watch</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> They can get a better understanding of the games featured in the content</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The creators are likable, relatable, and can sometimes be a little quirky</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The creators do not give up playing the game quickly even if the game proves difficult</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In conclusion, according to the survey, the <span style="font-weight: bold">needs to be satisfied</span> are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> More games that feature multiplayer/collaboration should be playedy</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> An atmosphere that is more focused on having fun and not always on winning</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> More gameplay videos that are casual that uses appropriate, inoffensive humor</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">The necessary steps to produce a good stream</span>
                <p>In order to produce content that is satisfactory to our audience, the team must prepare the proper equipment and software to use record footage, edit clips and audio, etc. in order to provide a visually pleasing experience for the viewer. Additionally, applying the needs mentioned by the participants is also essential to create content that accommodates those needs, and in turn, further satisfies the viewer.
